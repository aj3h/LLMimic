# LLMimic

## Overview
LLMimic is a modular Python framework designed to personalize interactions with LLaMa-based LLMs. It supports customizable personas, a WIP memory system, and optional features like weather integration and chess gameplay. Perfect for exploring AI-human interaction with a personal touch.

## Features
- **Persona Management**: Create and manage rich backstories.
- **Memory System (WIP)**: Entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and text classification with JSON storage.
- **Chat Summarizer**: Reduces token usage for longer conversations.
- **Weather Integration**: Fetch real-time geographical weather with OpenWeatherAPI.
- **Toggleable Modules**: Enable or disable features for flexibility.
- **Chess Module**: Play chess alongside chatting (coming soon).

## Current Limitations
- Memory data is stored but not integrated into responses.
- No token management for very long chats.
- Chess is mostly complete, but hasn't been integrated yet.
- Planned features (fine-tuning, randomness module) are in early stages.
